# Empowering-Early-Detection-of-Heart-Attack-Risks-with-Machine-Learning
This project uses machine learning to predict heart attack risk based on health indicators like age, BMI, and medical history. Using the Kaggle dataset, multiple models were evaluated, with AdaBoost achieving 85% accuracy. The goal is to support early diagnosis and preventive care.
