## Empowering Early Detection of Heart Attack Risks with Machine Learning

###  Overview
This project uses machine learning models to predict the risk of heart attacks based on key health indicators. The goal is to assist in early diagnosis and encourage preventive care by identifying at-risk individuals.

###  Dataset
- **Source:** [Kaggle - Personal Key Indicators of Heart Disease](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kamilpytlak/personal-key-indicators-of-heart-disease)
- Features include age, BMI, smoking habits, physical activity, alcohol use, and medical history.
- Binary target variable: presence (1) or absence (0) of heart disease.

###  Methodology
- Data preprocessing: missing values, encoding, scaling
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): correlation and feature impact
- Model training: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, KNN, Naive Bayes, AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost
- Evaluation: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score

###  Results
- **Top-performing model:** AdaBoost with 85% test accuracy
- Models showed consistent recall and accuracy; precision varied slightly
- Balanced performance observed in Gradient Boost and XGBoost
